T31 - Install PostgreSQL on core-01
T32 - Secure Postgres basics (roles, users, least privilege)
T33 - Allow workload-01 to connect to Postgres securely
T34 - Define DB conventions (naming, roles per client)
T35 - Manual backup #1 (pg_dump) and store predictably
T36 - Manual restore #1 into a new DB name
T37 - DB failure drill (stop/start/restart and validate)
T38 - DB health checks (simple commands + expected output)
T39 - DB access audit (who can connect and from where)
T40 - Incident report 0002 (database-related)
T41 - Define first app spec (Notes/Todo API endpoints + config)
T42 - Build minimal API locally (runs on dev machine)
T43 - Add Postgres integration (create/read/write data)
T44 - Move config to env vars (no hardcoded secrets)
T45 - Deploy app to workload-01 manually (deps + files)
T46 - Run app via systemd as non-root user

T50 - Break-and-recover drill for the app (config/crash)
T51 - Define client model (DB + user + config + routing)
T52 - Create Client A manually (DB/user/creds)
T53 - Create Client B manually (DB/user/creds)
T54 - Configure app for Client A (works end-to-end)
T55 - Configure app for Client B (works end-to-end)
T56 - Decide routing method (port/hostname/path) and document
T57 - Implement routing with reverse proxy on workload-01
T58 - Isolation test: Client A broken, Client B still works
T59 - Write client lifecycle checklist (create/update/delete)
